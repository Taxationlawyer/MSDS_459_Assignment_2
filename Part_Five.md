# Part Five

So far, the assigned book chapters have discussed ad nauseum the topics of support vector machines, nearest neighbors (K-Means methods), and vectors to represent information in a database. The aforementioned discussions are great for having and understanding of the topics. However, the problem is that the inexperienced person has no direction on how to implement the said methods. Enter pgvector. Pgvector implements most of the processes that are discussed in the chapters of the books for the term project. 

Pgvector can be implemented in Python or Go. It would be a great experience to implement pgvector in one of the aforementioned languages, because it will provide hands on experience for the practitioner of data science. There are other advantages of using pgvector for the term project. Pgvector appears to use support vector machines for classification. It uses tuples, a method that is the cornerstone of support vector machines. This, along with other methods (nearest neighbor and vectors), means that pgvector can be used to mine large schema data bases for “relevant” information. Additionally, such mining can be used to extract insights and patterns that can be used to add meaningful value to the term project. 

However, there are disadvantages. There is a learning curve to get familiar and to implement pgvector. This is the fifth week of a 10-week term. So, there is not much time left to finish the project. Also, using pgvector assumes that large schema databases are available to mine. If such large databases were available, then pgvector would be an invaluable process to use—to extract valuable information (data, insights, and patterns) from very large schema databases.
