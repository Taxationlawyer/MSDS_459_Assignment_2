# Part Two 

Imagine an interface that makes PostgreSQL easier and more robust to use. Enter, GEL (formerly known as EdgeDB). GEL works with PostgreSQL and makes queering (1) easier, (2) more robust (graph-relational data model), and (3) faster (to create commands and to execute tasks). This is an interesting interface that was long overdue. Traditionally, queries were performed using SQL. For many decades, SQL was the standard. GEL has changed the landscape. 

(1) GEL runs on EdgeQL and requires substantially fewer lines of “code” for queries. Additionally, GEL has commands that are easier to grasp and implement. Fore example, GEL uses commands like “if ___, then ___, else____.” Essentially, whatever can be done in SQL can be done with GEL, in a more streamlined (shorter) form. 

(2) GEL is more robust than traditional data base schema systems because it is a graph-relational data model. In short, GEL is a combination of a data base schema setup and a graph-relational data model (graph-relational data schema + graph-relational data model = GEL). 

(3) GEL is substantially faster because it requires fewer command lines. Also, the queries run substantially faster than the other available options. Also, because the commands are shorter, GEL is easier to learn. All of this means that GEL can be instrumental in creating a more efficient and productive data-driven workplace.

In summary, GEL has disrupted the SQL landscape by being a more robust, efficient, and practical data querying tool. Although GEL is a graph relational model, it is not suitable for use in the term project for this course, however. The knowledge graph produced by GEL is limited to the available data that is available in the database schema. Put another way, to build the knowledge base using GEL, all the “relevant” information is needed beforehand. GEL can be extremely useful for searching databases, however. GEL can be used to glean useful insights from knowledge base schemas. And that information can be used for the term project for this course.
