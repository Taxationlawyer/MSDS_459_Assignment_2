# Part Three
PostgreSQL is a data base schema device. It is used to build solid and structured databases and to perform queries on the same. PostgreSQL, by itself, is not much of a data mining resource. Enter Timescale, it bridges the gap between the SQL and the data science territory. Timescale is incredibly fast at ingesting data. That means that it is more efficient and practical for business applications. Along with that, Timescale runs real-time analytics. This piece will touch on three key features of Timescale: (1) speed and efficiency, (2) runs on top of PostgreSQL, and (3) performs real-time analytics. 

(1) Timescale is incredibly fast and is much faster and efficient than PostgreSQL alone. Timescale can ingest an incredible amount of data at very fast speeds. This is useful for analyzing large amounts of data in real time. 

(2) Timescale leverages the practicality and reliability of the time proven SQL database schema format; it does this by running on top with PostgreSQL. 

(3) Moreover, Timescale performs real time analytics. For example, Timescale performs time series analytics in real time.

In conclusion, Timescale can be used for the term project to glean insights from large schema databases. Timescale is fast, practical, and robust. That is an advantage of using Timescale for the term project. On the other hand, large schema databases are needed to be able to leverage the value of Timescale. That is a disadvantage because that large database might not be available, however. If such a large data base existed that contained all of the “relevant” information, then the term project would be incredibly easy, because (for starters) the knowledge graph could be built directly from the large database.
