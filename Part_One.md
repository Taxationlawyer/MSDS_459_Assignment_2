# Part One

Chapter Six of the “Knowledge Graphs” book continues the discussion of information extraction. Moreover, the same chapter discusses information that is relevant to building an ontology (a Knowledge Graph). A knowledge graph is not complete without the relationships connecting the nodes. The nodes can be generated using a process called Named Entity Recognition (NER). Other information that is extracted from the data includes events and relationships. There are a few methods that can be used to identify the “relevant” information to be extracted: (1) feature based methods, (2) kernel-based processes, and (3) supervised and unsupervised techniques. 

(1) Feature based methods can include classification systems. One model that is mentioned is the support vector machines. Interestingly, support vector machines work by categorizing information (tuples) on a higher plane; this allows the support vector machines to work with an incredible amount of data and lump the data into tuples. According to the literature, support vector machines perform well with Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. 

(2) The kernel-based methods are supervised methods and are in fact similar to support vector machines. The kernels appear to be performing the functions that the tuples in support vector machines rely on. Tuples (or kernels), the cornerstone of support vector machines, represent an incredible amount of information on a “higher plane”

(3) Information extraction is done using supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods include support vector machines, trees, CNNs, and other methods. Unsupervised methods include hierarchical clustering and nearest neighbor methods (K-Means clustering). 

In conclusion, what is old is new. All of the methods that are mentioned in Chapter Six have been around for decades. Support vector machines appeared to be the underdog, prior to the development of knowledge graphs. And, now, support vector machines are at the forefront of data mining—in the knowledge graph (ontology) field.
