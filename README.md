Tried and true schema databases have been available for decades. And SQL has traditionally been used to query the schema databases. These processes have been stable and very reliable. Today, companies process and query an incredible amount of information that requires time and computing resources. 

There are new methods that make processing and analyzing data faster and more practical (e.g., GELâ€”formerly known as EdgeDB). Some of these methods are a combination of schema databases and knowledge graphs (schema databases + knowledge graphs = GEL). Additionally, some of the available resources provide data visualizations (e.g., time series analytics) in real time. 

In summary, some of the available methods are based on Postgres. That makes the software easy to use for people who are well versed in using Postgres. Moreover, some of the methods employ tuples (support vector machine methods) and nearest neighbors processes; these are machine learning methods. Consequently, machine learning methods have been leveraged to add value (practicality and speed) to schema databases.
